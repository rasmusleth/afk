This routes folder act as our Controller (in MVC)
- For smaller applications, we could simply all our routes inside our "server.js" file, but as the app gets bigger, it gets really hard to manage

Whenever we create a new route, we need to import that route into our server
- For an example, see how the "index"-route has been importet into our "server.js"-file
